Two qubits, both alike in state,
in fair Geneva, where we lay our scene,
bonded tightly from the beginning,
then ripped apart from each other's arms,
sent far away, away from their reach.
This is their story.
 
This is a story.
This is a love story.
This is a tragic love story.
Two souls. Two qubits. Alice and Bob.
Joint from the beginning, taken apart in the end.
Ssshhh! A call between remote places. A silent call, on a link no one can spy on.

Alice: Bob! Wait, I'm coming for you!
Bob: Alice! I will cross the world just to be with you again!
Evil Eve: Observers! Disperse over the world, look out for those two! We cannot foresee what would happen if they join together!
